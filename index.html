	<div class="nervous wow fadeIn" data-wow-offset="600" style="background-image: url(images/nervous-overlay.png)">
		<p class="system-left">NERVOUS SYSTEM</p>
		<p class="description-left">This is the system that connects the puny human brain to their fragile, jelly-like spines. Their nerves allow them to feel countless amounts of infinite pain as they are being punished in the fiery depths of the underworld. When suffering pain, nerves in the extremeties of their bodies send signals to their brain; telling them how much it hurts and how pathetic they are.</p>
		<p class="caption-left">Pictured here is the puny BRAIN.</p>

	</div>

	<div class="endocrine wow fadeIn" data-wow-offset="650" style="background-image: url(images/endocrine-overlay.png)">
		<p class="system-right">ENDOCRINE SYSTEM</p>
		<p class="description-right">The organs of this system mercilessly force humans to sucrete awkward fluids and exude foul stenches with the intention of making them feel uncomfortable and—hopefully—embarrassing them to their deaths.</p>

		<p class="caption-right">Pictured here is the dumb THYROID GLAND.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="respiratory wow fadeIn" data-wow-offset="400">
		<p class="system-left">RESPIRATORY SYSTEM</p>
		<p class="description-left">Unfortunately, human beings rely on oxygen to stay alive, unlike demons who are sustained by the pained screams of the tormented. This system is a series of pipes that allows a human to breathe oxygen and subsequently let out the desirable pained screams that we demons thrive upon.<p>

	</div>

	<div class="cardiovascular wow fadeIn" data-wow-offset="400">
		<p class="system-right">CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM</p>
		<p class="description-right">Ahhh, delicious blood. This system is composed of red and blue bendy straws that are connected to a squishy button, known as the heart, that we use to pump blood into our mugs.</p> 
	</div>

	<div class="muscular wow fadeIn" data-wow-offset="400">
		<p class="system-left">MUSCULAR SYSTEM</p>
		<p class="description-left">Muscles enable humans to writhe and squirm when in pain. They can also serve as sustenance for demons. Usually, human muscles aren't very tender. Many humans are flabby, although being "fit" has become quite trendy in recent years, hinting at a very desirable change.<p>
	</div>

	<!--The muscular system is responsible for the movement of the human body. Attached to the bones of the skeletal system are about 700 named muscles that make up roughly half of a person’s body weight. Each of these muscles is a discrete organ constructed of skeletal muscle tissue, blood vessels, tendons, and nerves. Muscle tissue is also found inside of the heart, digestive organs, and blood vessels. In these organs, muscles serve to move substances throughout the body.-->

	<div class="digestive wow fadeIn" data-wow-offset="400">
		<p class="system-right">DIGESTIVE SYSTEM</p>
		<p class="description-right">This system allows humans to consume and ingest the disgusting material they call "food." Their intestines enable them to relieve themselves of their putrid waste.</p> 
	</div>

	<!--The digestive system is a group of organs working together to convert food into energy and basic nutrients to feed the entire body. Food passes through a long tube inside the body known as the alimentary canal or the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract). The alimentary canal is made up of the oral cavity, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestines, and large intestines. In addition to the alimentary canal, there are several important accessory organs that help your body to digest food but do not have food pass through them. Accessory organs of the digestive system include the teeth, tongue, salivary glands, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas.-->

	<div class="reproductive wow fadeIn" data-wow-offset="400">
		<p class="system-left">REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM</p>
		<p class="description-left">The male reproductive system usually includes a tiny, fleshy appendage with two squishy spheres that dangle from the human groin. The female reproductive system is generally a small, smelly slit that opens into the groin. Together, these two systems create smaller and more inept human beings.</p>

	<!--The male reproductive system includes the scrotum, testes, spermatic ducts, sex glands, and penis. These organs work together to produce sperm, the male gamete, and the other components of semen. These organs also work together to deliver semen out of the body and into the vagina where it can fertilize egg cells to produce offspring. The female reproductive system includes the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, vagina, vulva, mammary glands and breasts. These organs are involved in the production and transportation of gametes and the production of sex hormones. The female reproductive system also facilitates the fertilization of ova by sperm and supports the development of offspring during pregnancy and infancy.-->	
	</div>

	<div class="urinary wow fadeIn" data-wow-offset="400">
		<p class="system-right">URINARY SYSTEM</p>
		<p class="description-right">In some bizarre fashion, the human sexual organs are also used to rid their bodies of waste. Humans produce urine from organs known as "kidneys" and release said urine through their sexual organs. A curious notion; urinating and ejaculating from the same orifice? How strange...and disgusting.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="immune wow fadeIn" data-wow-offset="400">
		<p class="system-left">IMMUNE/LYMPHATIC SYSTEM</p>
		<p class="description-left">The immune and lymphatic systems serve as the human body's embarrassing defense system. Only powerful enough to protect them from things like germs or dirt, this system is useless against the infinite number of torture devices that we demons utilize.</p> 
	</div>

<!--The immune and lymphatic systems are two closely related organ systems that share several organs and physiological functions. The immune system is our body’s defense system against infectious pathogenic viruses, bacteria, and fungi as well as parasitic animals and protists. The immune system works to keep these harmful agents out of the body and attacks those that manage to enter. The lymphatic system is a system of capillaries, vessels, nodes, and other organs that transport a fluid called lymph from the tissues as it returns to the bloodstream. The lymphatic tissue of these organs filters and cleans the lymph of any debris, abnormal cells, or pathogens. The lymphatic system also transports fatty acids from the intestines to the circulatory system.-->

	<div class="skeletal wow fadeIn" data-wow-offset="400">
		<p class="system-right">SKELETAL SYSTEM</p>
		<p class="description-right">Perhaps the only useful system of the human body, the skeletal system gives human beings their shape and structure. Human bones can be re-purposed as weapons and tools for torment.</p> 
	</div>	

<!--The skeletal system includes all of the bones and joints in the body. Each bone is a complex living organ that is made up of many cells, protein fibers, and minerals. The skeleton acts as a scaffold by providing support and protection for the soft tissues that make up the rest of the body. The skeletal system also provides attachment points for muscles to allow movements at the joints. New blood cells are produced by the red bone marrow inside of our bones. Bones act as the body’s warehouse for calcium, iron, and energy in the form of fat. Finally, the skeleton grows throughout childhood and provides a framework for the rest of the body to grow along with it.-->

	<div class="integumentary wow fadeIn" data-wow-offset="400">
		<p class="system-left">INTEGUMENTARY SYSTEM</p>
		<p class="description-left">Serving as the most useless system of the human body, this system is composed of things such as skin, hair, and nails, which would all disintegrate instantly in the fiery pits of the underworld.</p> 
	</div>	

<!--The integumentary system is an organ system consisting of the skin, hair, nails, and exocrine glands. The skin is only a few millimeters thick yet is by far the largest organ in the body. The average person’s skin weighs 10 pounds and has a surface area of almost 20 square feet. Skin forms the body’s outer covering and forms a barrier to protect the body from chemicals, disease, UV light, and physical damage. Hair and nails extend from the skin to reinforce the skin and protect it from environmental damage. The exocrine glands of the integumentary system produce sweat, oil, and wax to cool, protect, and moisturize the skin’s surface.-->
