	</div>

	<div class="nervous wow fadeIn" data-wow-offset="600" style="background-image: url(images/nervous-overlay.png)">
		<p class="system-left">NERVOUS SYSTEM</p>
		<p class="description-left">This is the system that connects the puny human brain to their fragile, jelly-like spines. Their nerves allow them to feel countless amounts of infinite pain as they are being punished in the fiery depths of the underworld. When suffering pain, nerves in their bodies send signals to their brain; telling them how much it hurts and how pathetic they are.</p>
		<p class="caption-left">Pictured here is the puny BRAIN.</p>

	</div>

	<div class="endocrine wow fadeIn" data-wow-offset="550" style="background-image: url(images/endocrine-overlay.png)">
		<p class="system-right">ENDOCRINE SYSTEM</p>
		<p class="description-right">The organs of this system mercilessly force humans to sucrete awkward fluids and exude foul stenches with the intention of making them feel uncomfortable and—hopefully—embarrassing them to their deaths.</p>

		<p class="caption-right">Pictured here is the dumb THYROID GLAND.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="respiratory wow fadeIn" data-wow-offset="400" style="background-image: url(images/respiratory-overlay.png)">
		<p class="system-left">RESPIRATORY SYSTEM</p>
		<p class="description-left">Unfortunately, human beings rely on oxygen to stay alive, unlike demons who are sustained by the pained screams of the tormented. This system is a series of pipes that allows a human to breathe oxygen and subsequently let out the desirable pained screams that we demons thrive upon.<p>

		<p class="caption-left">Pictured here is the unfortunate LUNG.</p>

	</div>

	<div class="cardiovascular wow fadeIn" data-wow-offset="400" style="background-image: url(images/cardiovascular-overlay.png)">
		<p class="system-right">CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM</p>
		<p class="description-right">Ahhh, delicious blood. This system is composed of red and blue bendy straws that are connected to a squishy button, known as the heart, that we use to pump blood into our mugs.</p> 

		<p class="caption-right">Pictured here is the button or HEART.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="muscular wow fadeIn" data-wow-offset="400" style="background-image: url(images/muscular-overlay.png)">
		<p class="system-left">MUSCULAR SYSTEM</p>
		<p class="description-left">Muscles enable humans to writhe and squirm when in pain. They can also serve as sustenance for demons. Usually, human muscles aren't very tender. Many humans are flabby, although being "fit" has become quite trendy in recent years, hinting at a very desirable change.<p>
		<p class="caption-left">Pictured here are tender forearm MUSCLES.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="digestive wow fadeIn" data-wow-offset="400" style="background-image: url(images/digestive-overlay.png)">
		<p class="system-right">DIGESTIVE SYSTEM</p>
		<p class="description-right">This system allows humans to consume and ingest the disgusting material they call "food." Their intestines enable them to relieve themselves of their putrid waste.</p>
		<p class="caption-right">Pictured here are the disgusting INTESTINES.</p> 
	</div>

	<div class="reproductive wow fadeIn" data-wow-offset="400" style="background-image: url(images/reproductive-overlay.png)">
		<p class="system-left">REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM</p>
		<p class="description-left">The male reproductive system usually includes a tiny, fleshy appendage with two squishy spheres that dangle from the human groin. The female reproductive system is generally a small, smelly slit that opens into the groin. Together, these two systems create smaller and more inept human beings.</p>
		<p class="caption-left">Pictured here are what the humans call a PENIS and a VAGINA.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="urinary wow fadeIn" data-wow-offset="400" style="background-image: url(images/urinary-overlay.png)">
		<p class="system-right">URINARY SYSTEM</p>
		<p class="description-right">In some bizarre fashion, the human sexual organs are also used to rid their bodies of waste. Humans, produce urine from organs known as "kidneys" and release said urine through their sexual organs. Disgusting.</p>
		<p class="caption-right">Pictured here are the tiny KIDNEYS.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="immune wow fadeIn" data-wow-offset="400" style="background-image: url(images/immune-overlay.png)">
		<p class="system-left">IMMUNE/LYMPHATIC SYSTEM</p>
		<p class="description-left">The immune and lymphatic systems serve as the human body's embarrassing defense system. Only powerful enough to protect them from things like germs or dirt, this system is useless against the infinite number of torture devices that we demons utilize.</p> 
		<p class="caption-left">Pictured is the least useless human bone (femur), which contains BONE MARROW.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="skeletal wow fadeIn" data-wow-offset="400" style="background-image: url(images/skeletal-overlay.png)">
		<p class="system-right">SKELETAL SYSTEM</p>
		<p class="description-right">Perhaps the only useful system of the human body, the skeletal system gives human beings their shape and structure. Human bones can be re-purposed as weapons and tools for torment.</p>
		<p class="caption-right">Pictured is the highly vulnerable "shin bone" or TIBIA.</p> 
	</div>

	<div class="integumentary wow fadeIn" data-wow-offset="400" style="background-image: url(images/integumentary-overlay.png)">
		<p class="system-left">INTEGUMENTARY SYSTEM</p>
		<p class="description-left">Serving as the most useless system of the human body, this system is composed of things such as skin, hair, and nails, which would all disintegrate instantly in the fiery pits of the underworld.</p> 
		<p class="caption-left">Pictured here is the pathetic FOOT.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="goodbye">
